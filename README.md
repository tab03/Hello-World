# Hello-World
My name is Don aka tabs03
A Computer Engineer and Electronics technician.
My work is Mobile phone technician, and a father of 5.
I'm not a hobby coder programmer, I feel lazyness when I heard coding/programming, maybe because I'm a busy person.
Because I feel older @42, I have a plan to pursue my career as an educator, exploring everything and collect more knowledge to further my education.
Thank you.
@my Lab.
